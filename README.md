# Covid-19 Dashboard
This dashboard system was built during the COVID lockdowns. It allows quick overviews of COVID case numbers from across the globe using data sourced from https://disease.sh.

# Hosting
The application is hosted on https://covid.stefan-wright.com, it is hosted on Google Firebase hosting

# Stack used 
The application was built using React and Typescript. I used Styled Components to handle the styling of my elements, and this was my first time implementing the React Context API into a solution.
